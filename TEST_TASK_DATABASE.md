# Test Database

Implement working own simple database engine with an API with description of what is implement and why to choose certain approach.

## Description
The database is an organized collection of information potentially needed in the future. Implement database using NodeJS. The recommended subject area is simple contacts list, where one record contains Name and Phone Number. You are able to choose your own subject area - it will be a plus.

The database server may consist of several independent blocks:

* Database engine
* API (console, http, socket)

The database server supports the following operations:

* Add record to the database
* Get record from the database
* Update existing record
* Delete existing record
* Get list of records

## Requirements
* Application should be completely based on NodeJS
* Support of all [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations
* Access to the database by any implemented [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) (for example, console, http, sockets). Using [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) will a plus.
* The ability to save to a file so that you can reboot the server (for example, flush, commit or snapshot approach)
* Application should log all actions

## It’s allowed to use for implementation
* NodeJS
* Any frameworks for the API
* Any approaches and libraries for logging

## Advanced futures (optional)
* Single page web application (any front-end framework allowed)
* Sharding mechanism
* Scaling mechanism

## Possible subject areas
* Contacts list
* Movie catalogue
* Songs catalogue
* Restaurant menu
* Orders list
* etc.
